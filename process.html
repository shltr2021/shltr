First, there was an opportunity to provide an engaging experience to a person waiting for transportation. Second, transportation was used to help people find their way around a city, but we could look more closely into whether it could be used to help people find their place in the city.</p>

In our research, we found that loneliness could be reduced by simply acknowledging it, and one way to do this was to write down your feelings in a diary. It was this that gave us the idea of transforming the physical bus shelter into a virtual public diary that allowed commuters to share their feelings.</p>
